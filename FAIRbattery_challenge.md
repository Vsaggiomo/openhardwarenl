## Background and motivation
The most common renewable energy sources, solar and wind electricity, are intermittent. The storage of energy in batteries, is therefore an essential link in localizing and democratizing access to electricity. To reach the deployment level necessary for the Paris agreement, energy storage facilities in ALL scales, from domestic to industrial, are needed immediately. 

Current industrial storage solutions, however, are mostly aimed at the needs of countries in the global north (electric mobility, large scale facilities), while they still rely on exploiting minerals from the global south. This is making the electrification transition squarely unfair and unsustainable. The solution we envision for providing widely scalable and affordable democratic access to energy storage is to put the actual needs and conditions of the end-users right at the beginning of the design process.

The main goal of the FAIR Battery challenge is to develop an open-source electrochemical battery technology that can be deployed and maintained in the field, for residential users, small scale commercial use, and rural health posts. The unusual aspect of this project is that we aim at practical affordability, reliability, safety, circularity, and accessibility of the batteries developed in this project

To reach our goal of making this technology widely accessible, it is essential that we also make the training material open-access and provide access to the expertise network. Therefore, we are setting up this challenge based on collaboration instead of competiton.

# Participation guidelines
Participation is possible in 3 catogories:

## 1- Full system: 
fully functional battery systems (12, 24, or 48 V) with power of at least 250 W and storage capacity of 1 kWh
	+ safe for functioning outside laboratory in ambient environment
	+ bill of materials should not exceed 3000 Euros
	+ more than 50% of the components must be open source licensed
	
## 2- Test and Maintenance
teams can decide on which component of the battery ecosystem they want to provide. Examples are electrolyte, BMS, stacks, membranes, storage system, warning and control, charge statge measurement, etc.

Each element will be evaluate separately. [rules to be defined]


## Evaluation
Judgment will be at various stages based on a point system. 

Open sharing principle: Contributions used by other teams will obtain extra points based on the usage in other groups and inventions.


## Our offer [to be discussed]
+ materials and equipment
+ mentorship during the open hardware makers program
+ winner will recieved a fellowship to develop a full training workshop around their invention
